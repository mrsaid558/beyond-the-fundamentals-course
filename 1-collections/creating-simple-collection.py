# this is the second lesson in chapter 1 and it's about collections
'''
creating a simple collection

    - we can say that collection is provides a lot of effort so instead of we 
        write a variables and store in them values from the same kind of data type we can to
        create the list
'''

# before we learn the list
city1 = "Egypt"
city2 = "Aswan"
city3 = "Suhaj"
city4 = "Cairo"

# after we learn the list

cities = [
    "Egypt",
    "Aswan", 
    "Suhaj", 
    "Cairo"
]

print(cities)
